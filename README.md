# System-Design-Fundamentals

## Client-Server

DNS query → HTTP request

- **IP address**: A unique identifier for a machine
- **DNS**: Domain Name System query to get IP address
- **Server**: Specified which port to listen（ex. http uses port 80, https uses port 443）

## Network Protocols

### **IP**

- packet = fundamental unit of data that is sent from one to another
- packet = header + data
    1. header usually contains source/destination IP address 
    2. IP version（IPV4 most uses）（IPV6 more and more now）
- Can’t guarantee order of packets

### **TCP**

- build on top of IP
- Can guarantee order of packets（resent .etc）
- packet = header + TCP header + data
- handshake

### **HTTP**

- build on top of TCP
- following request response paradigm
- method, statusCode .etc

## Storage

- Database is just a server.
- store/retrieve
- Different offerings for different use case.

### Persistance

- Usually refers to disk, but in general it is any form of storage that persists even it dies.
